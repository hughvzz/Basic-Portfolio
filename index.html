     <p>
         My name is Hugo Vázquez and I live in Monterrey, Mexico. I'm currently studying Business Informatics
         at Tec de Monterrey. I live near the Puente Atirantado with my parents and two sisters. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am also working part-time at a software company named Block Networks as a Project Manager. I'm
        in the company's soccer team as a striker. Soccer is my favorite sport and I've played it since
        elementary school.
        <br>
        <br>
        Right now I have a couple of friends that came up with a business idea and we are currently working
        on it. It's going great but we are now thinking of adding the service via web. So this is basically
        the main reason why I got into this bootcamp.
